# Preface {-}

In this book, you’ll learn Python through the power of AI, making you the central character in your learning journey. You'll write prompts that guide your progress, unlocking new levels of understanding as you go. With Gemini AI integrated into Google Colab, your coding experience will be interactive, personalized, and truly exciting. 

# Data Types

In Python, **data types** define the kind of value a variable can hold. They are the building blocks of any Python program and allow the interpreter to allocate memory and perform operations efficiently. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to declare a variable’s type explicitly—Python infers it automatically when the value is assigned.

## 1. Numeric Types

- `int`: Represents whole numbers (e.g., `42`, `-7`, `0`)
- `float`: Represents decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.001`)
- `complex`: Represents complex numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., `2 + 3j`)

## 2. Text Type

- `str`: A sequence of Unicode characters, used to represent text (e.g., `"Hello, world!"`)

## 3. Boolean Type

- `bool`: Represents logical values and can be either `True` or `False`

## 4. Sequence Types

- `list`: An ordered, mutable collection (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`)
- `tuple`: An ordered, immutable collection (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`)
- `range`: Represents a sequence of numbers, often used in loops (e.g., `range(0, 10)`)

## 5. Set Types

- `set`: An unordered collection of unique items (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`)
- `frozenset`: An immutable version of a set

## 6. Mapping Type

- `dict`: A collection of key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`)

## 7. None Type

- `NoneType`: Represents the absence of a value or a null value (e.g., `None`)

## Why Data Types Matter

Understanding data types helps in:

- Writing correct and efficient code
- Avoiding type errors during operations (e.g., adding a string and an integer)
- Designing better data structures and algorithms

Python provides built-in functions like `type()` to check the data type of a variable:



```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
